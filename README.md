# CONDORCET-JURY-GAME

The Condorcet Jury Game explores how group size and individual probability of being correct impact the overall decision accuracy of a jury. The theorem shows that as long as each juror is more likely than not to make the correct decision, increasing the number of jurors improves the probability that the majority vote is correct.

This project allows users to simulate the game, visualize, and understand how collective intelligence can be a powerful force in democratic decision-making.
